# magenta

This set has been created to help you out with magenta on Python.  I used Anaconda with Python 3.7.11

Required modules are in requirements.txt

For some scripts you need to download extra models/sets like basic_rnn.mag.  The files needed are shown in the python files.

Mostly https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/magenta/hello_magenta/hello_magenta.ipynb#scrollTo=K1o5dZjR57c_  is used.  Only it is hard to get Music VAE working on Windows.  So I advice to use a linux environment.

As a teaser I created quickly a remix of TwinkleTwinkle, see wav file
